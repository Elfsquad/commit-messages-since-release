The `jira-extract-issue-keys` GitHub Action is designed for automating the extraction of JIRA issue keys from commit messages. This action supports extracting issue keys from conventional commit messages (`feat(EC-12345): ...`).

== üìñ Usage

To incorporate this action into your workflow, specify your GitHub token and, if applicable, the release tag you're targeting.

[source,yaml]
----
# Example workflow configuration
name: Extract JIRA Issue Keys Workflow
on: [push]

jobs:
  key-extraction:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Extract JIRA Issue Keys
        uses: Elfsquad/jira-extract-issue-keys@main
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          # Optional: specify if targeting a specific release
          release-tag: 'v1.0.0'
----

== üîß Inputs

* `token`: **Required**. Your GitHub token for authentication.
* `release-tag`: Optional. The base release tag to use for comparison. If not specified, the action will default to the latest release tag.

== üì§ Outputs

* `issue-keys`: A string containing the extracted JIRA issue keys, separated by commas.

== ü§ñ How it Works

The action parses commit messages for patterns matching JIRA issue keys (e.g., PROJ-123) and compiles a list of these keys for use in subsequent workflow steps or for audit purposes.
